RBAC --> Role based access control.
User Management --> what actions can the user perform on the kubernetes cluster.
Service Account --> what actions can the resource which is attached to a service account can perform on cluter.

main components of kubernetes:
Service accounts / Users
Roles / Cluster Roles
Role Binding / Cluster Role Binding

Roles/Clusterroles can be attached to users, groups, service accounts.

Role/cluter role is where we define what permissions user/sa should have, It is attached to a user/sa using Rolebinding/Cluster role binding.

Users cannot be created on kubernetes cluster only the rbac is taken care by kubernetes. User management should be taken care by identity providers.
