    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. They are known for their
        distinctive long trunk, large ears, and tusks made of ivory. Elephants are found in various habitats including
        savannas, forests, and deserts. They are highly intelligent animals and have a complex social structure.</p>

    <h2>Species</h2>
    <p>There are three species of elephants: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian
        elephant. African elephants are larger than their Asian counterparts and have larger ears.</p>

    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>Elephants are found in different habitats across Africa and Asia. They require a lot of water and eat large
        quantities of food. Due to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, elephants are classified as vulnerable and
        endangered species.</p>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <p>Elephants are known for their social behavior. They live in groups called herds, usually consisting of related
        females and their offspring. Male elephants, known as bulls, often live alone or in smaller bachelor groups. They
        communicate with each other using various sounds and infrasound, and they have a strong sense of smell.</p>

    <h2>Conservation</h2>

        creatures for future generations.</p>
