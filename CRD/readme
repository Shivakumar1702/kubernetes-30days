Custom Resource Definition:
There are in built resources in k8s like pod, svc, deployment, replicaset. If we want to a custom resource to extend the existing
functionality of kubernetes then we can use CRD.

CRD: Defining a new type of API to kubernetes. Team building the CRD will submit the CRD to k8s.
    when user submit a yml file for Custom resource, this will get validated with the Custom resource Definition.
    this is same as deployment.yml will be validated with inbuilt resource deployment in k8s. and the deployment is managed by a replicaset controller.
    similarly Custom resource will be managed by custom controller.

============

Horizontal pod autoscaler: 
whenever load is high, number of pods will be autoscaled and when load decreased the pods counts will be reduced.
the load is monitored by metrics server.
