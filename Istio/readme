Istio:
Istio is a service mesh, service mesh manages communication between microservices.
Inside the cluster one service can easily talk with other service freely without any restriction.
Additional logic required inside the cluster to restrict unnecessary communication/
Core features of Service mesh:
	traffic splitting: traffic can be split between existing service and a new version of the same service.
					  	(canary deployment)
In Istio: Envoy proxy works as proxy for the service(side car)
		  Istiod is the control plane component which injects Envoy proxy to all the microservices.
Istio can be implemented in k8s cluster by using CRD (custom resouce definition)
Virtual service and destination rule are the two yamls, used to configure the Istio.
Istio also contains Istio Ingress gateway. Istio Ingress gateway is an alternate to nginx Ingress controller.
